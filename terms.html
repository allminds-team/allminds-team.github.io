The terms “you” and “your” means you, your dependents if any, and any other person accessing your User Account.  </p>
            <p><strong>Note, Allminds is not a medical group. Any telehealth consults obtained through our Website and/or App are provided by independent medical practitioners including, but not limited to, Peak Mental Health - Licensed Clinical Social Worker PC (collectively, “PMH”), an independent provider group with a network of United States based health care providers (each, a “Provider”).

            </div>
            <!-- End Title -->

            <p>PMH Providers deliver clinical services via the Allminds platform to their patients. Allminds licenses the “Allminds” brand name to the independently owned and operated medical practices that use its platform and its administrative, business support, and other services. Providers are independently contracted or employed by the PMH. Providers are not contracted or employed by Allminds. The Providers, and not Allminds, are responsible for the quality and appropriateness of the care they render to you. Allminds and PMH do not provide any legal advice or representations in any way regarding any legal issues associated with advice, information, goods, or services offered by a Provider, including but not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations.   </p>
            <p>The Providers are independent of Allminds and are merely using the Website and App as a way to communicate with you. Allminds does not own or have an ownership interest in PMH and PMH does not own or have an ownership interest in Allminds. Any information or advice received from a Provider comes from them alone, and not from Allminds. Your interactions with the Providers via the Website and App are not intended to take the place of your relationship with your regular health care practitioners or primary care physician. Neither Allminds, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any third party who may promote the Website and App or Service or provide a link to the Service, shall be liable for any professional advice obtained from a Provider via the Website and App or Service, nor any information obtained on the Website and App. Allminds does not recommend or endorse any specific Providers, tests, physicians, medications, products, or procedures. You acknowledge that your reliance on any Providers or information delivered by the Providers via the Website and App or Service is solely at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for all risks associated herewith. </p>
            <p>Allminds does not make any representations or warranties about the training or skill of any Providers who deliver services via the Website and App or Service. You will be provided with available Providers based solely on the information you submit to the Website and App. You are ultimately responsible for choosing your particular Provider. </p>
            <p>The content of the Website and App and the Services, including without limitation, text, copy, audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics, and other visuals, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or recommendations of any kind by Allminds. You should always seek the advice of your qualified health care professionals with any questions or concerns you may have regarding your individual needs and any medical conditions. All information provided by Allminds, or in connection with any communications supported by Allminds, is intended to be for general information purposes only, and is in no way intended to create a Provider-patient relationship as defined by state or federal law. While Allminds facilitates your selection of, and communications with, Providers, Allminds does not provide medical services, and the doctor-patient relationship is between you and the PMH Provider you select. </p>
            <p>The medical services, treatment, and care you receive may vary depending on the Provider you interact with. Please contact your Provider or PMH directly for any questions regarding your care or medical treatment.</p>

              <h3>Not for Emergencies.</h3>
              <p>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD DIAL “911” IMMEDIATELY. </p>
              <p>Allminds’s Website, App and Services are not for medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not disregard or delay to seek medical advice based on anything that appears or does not appear on the Website and App. If you believe you have an emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately.</p>
              <p>You should seek emergency help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed. You should continue to consult with your primary provider and other healthcare professionals as recommended. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider concerning questions you have regarding a medical condition and before stopping, starting, or modifying any treatment or modification.</p>
              <p>Risks of Telehealth Services. Telehealth involves the delivery of healthcare services using electronic communications, information technology or other means between a healthcare provider and a patient who are not in the same physical location. While the provision of health care services using telehealth may offer certain potential benefits, there are also potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. The telehealth services are not a substitute for in-person health care in all cases. In order to use the Service, you will be required to review and agree to an informed consent regarding the use of telehealth (the “Patient Consent”) that will be provided to you by PMH and Providers through the Website and/or App. You agree that Allminds is a third-party beneficiary of the Patient Consent and has the right to enforce it against you.</p>
              <p>Not an Insurance Product. Neither Allminds nor PMH are insurers. The Services are not insurance products, and the amounts you pay to Allminds or PMH are not insurance premiums. If you desire any type of health or other insurance, you will need to purchase such insurance separately.</p>
              <p>Availability of Services. Allminds and PMH operate subject to state and federal regulations, and the Services may not be available in your state. You represent that you are not a person barred from enrolling for or receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions in which you may be located. Access to and use of the Website and App or the Services is limited exclusively to users located in States within the United States where the Services are available. Services are not available to users located outside the United States. Accessing the Website and App or Services from jurisdictions where content is illegal, or where we do not offer Services, is prohibited.</p>
              <p>Revisions to Terms of Use. Allminds may supplement, amend or otherwise modify this Terms of Use at any time. These changes will be posted on this or a similar page of the Website or the App, as applicable, emailed to the email address associated with your User Account (see below for definition) or posted to your User Account (see below for definition), and shall be deemed effective as of their stated effective or modification date. Any use of the Website or App after such changes will be deemed an acceptance of those changes. You agree to review the Terms of Use each time you access the Website and App so that you may be aware of any changes to these Terms of Use. </p>
              <p>Electronic Communications. When you use the Website, App or Services, or send e-mails, messages, and other communications from your desktop or mobile device to us, you are communicating with us electronically.

Message and data rates may apply. To stop receiving text messages text the word STOP to said text message. We may confirm your opt out by text message. If you subscribe to multiple types of text messages from us, we may unsubscribe you from the Service that most recently sent you a message or respond to your STOP message by texting you a request to identify Services you wish to stop.

              <h3>Supplemental Terms Applicable to Providers</h3>
            </div>
            <!-- End Title -->

            <p>These supplemental terms apply to Providers in addition to the other provisions of these Terms of Use. In the event of a conflict between the supplemental terms and any other terms herein, the supplemental terms shall prevail.</p>
            <p>To be a healthcare provider using the Website and App (for purposes of this Section, “Provider” or “you”) you must be a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or healthcare professional contracted or employed by PMH, and must agree to comply with all laws, medical board rules, and other rules and regulations applicable to you as a Provider or otherwise. Your relationship with the Allminds users (including, but not limited to, your PMH patients) is directly between you and the patient. The patient will never have a physician-patient relationship with Allminds. Allminds does not practice medicine and offers no medical services. As set forth more fully below, Provider is solely responsible for all agreements, consents, notices, and other interactions with patients and other consumers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider and PMH are solely responsible for all billings and collections from patients and other consumers, and Allminds shall have no liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any amounts owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.</p>
            <p>Allminds does not provide any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way regarding any legal or medical issues associated with Provider, goods, or services offered by Provider, including but not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations. Provider should seek legal counsel regarding any legal and compliance issues, and should not rely on any materials or content associated with the Services in determining Provider’s compliance obligations under law. Provider and Allminds agree that Allminds is not providing to customers, patients, or anyone else, medical advice or legal advice. THE ALLMINDS WEBSITE, THE APP AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT MEANT TO SUBSTITUTE OR MODIFY YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN ANY WAY.</p>
            <p>Provider will use the Website, the App and Services only in accordance with applicable standards of good medical practice and applicable law. While software products such as the Website, the App and Services can facilitate and improve the quality of service that Provider can offer patients, many factors, including but not limited to the provider/patient relationship can affect a patient outcome, and with intricate and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making it is often difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in what proportion they affected an outcome. Provider shall be solely responsible for its use of the Website, the App and Services, and the provision of medical services to Provider’s patients. In this regard, Provider releases Allminds and waives any and all potential claims against Allminds as a result of Provider’s use of the Website, the App and Services, and the provision of services to Provider’s patients.</p>
            <p>As a result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the patient care process, Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Allminds harmless from any claim by or on behalf of any patient of Provider, or by or on behalf of any other third party or person claiming damage by virtue of a familial or financial relationship with such a patient, which is brought against Allminds, regardless of the cause if such claim arises for any reason whatsoever, out of Provider’s use or operation of the Website, the App and Services. To the extent applicable, Provider will obtain Allminds’s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which Provider agrees to any finding of fault of Allminds or defect in the Website, the App or Services. Allminds will promptly notify Provider in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly provide Provider with the information reasonably required for the defense of the same, and grant to Provider exclusive control over its defense and settlement.</p>
            <p>If you submit, upload, transmit, or post any consents, notices, advice, recommendations, comments, files, videos, images, or other materials to us or our Website and App (“Provider Content”) or provide any Provider Content to patients or other consumers, you agree not to provide any Provider Content that (a) is defamatory, abusive, libelous, unlawful, obscene, threatening, harassing, fraudulent, pornographic, or harmful, or that could encourage criminal or unethical behavior, (b) violates or infringes the privacy, copyright, trademark, trade dress, trade secrets, or intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or (c) contains or transmits a virus or any other harmful component. Provider is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary agreements and consents from, and providing all required notices to, patients and other consumers. You agree not to contact other users through unsolicited e-mail, telephone calls, mailings, or any other method of communication. You represent and warrant to Allminds that you have the legal right and authorization to upload all Provider Content at the Website and App. Allminds shall have a royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable right and license to use the Provider Content however Allminds desires, including without limitation, to copy, modify, delete in its entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from or sell or distribute such Provider Content or incorporate such Provider Content into any form, medium, or technology throughout the world. Allminds is and shall be under no obligation: (i) to maintain any Provider Content in confidence; (ii) to pay to you any compensation for any Provider Content; or (iii) to respond to any Provider Content.</p>
            <p>Allminds does not regularly review Provider Content, but does reserve the right (but not the obligation) to monitor and edit or remove any Provider Content submitted to the Website and App. You grant Allminds the right to use the name that you submit in connection with any Provider Content. You agree not to use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any Provider Content. You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Provider Content you post to the Website and App or provide to patients or other consumers. Allminds and its affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Provider Content submitted by you or any third party.</p>
            <p>You shall not use or permit any of your employees, agents, or affiliates to market, promote, or solicit Allminds Products or Services in ways that would violate the CAN-SPAM ACT, the TCPA or any other laws. You shall not: (a) infringe on the rights of others; distribute chain letters or unsolicited bulk electronic mail (“spamming”); (b) propagate computer worms or viruses; (c) use a false identity; (d) attempt to gain unauthorized entry to any Website, App or network; or (e) infringe copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.</p>

            <p>Notice. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Terms of Use, Allminds may give or deliver all other notices to you by means of a general notice posted on this or a similar page of the Website or the App, as applicable, by email to the email address associated with your User Account or by posting to your User Account, and shall be deemed effective as of their stated effective dates.</p>
            <p>Severability. In the event that any of the Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Allminds and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof.</p>
            <p>Assignment. You may not assign, transfer, or delegate the Terms of Use or any part thereof without Allminds’s prior written consent. Allminds may freely transfer, assign, or delegate all or any part of the Terms of Use, and any rights or duties hereunder or thereunder. The Terms of Use will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, and permitted assignees of the Parties.</p>
            <p>No Third Party Rights. Unless expressly stated in the Terms of Use to the contrary, nothing herein is intended to confer any rights or remedies on any persons other than you, Allminds, PMH, and their affiliates. Nothing in the Terms of Use is intended to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third persons to you, Allminds, PMH, and its affiliates, nor shall any provision give any third parties any right of subrogation or action over against you, Allminds, PMH, and its affiliates.</p>
            <p>Copyright/Trademark Information. Copyright ©2020 Allminds, Inc. All rights reserved. All trademarks, logos, and service marks (“Marks”) displayed on the Website and App are our property or the property of other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party which may own the Marks.</p>
            <p>Dispute Resolution. We will try to work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with the Website or App, including without limitation, Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Website or App, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer's satisfaction. You and Allminds agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Website and/or App, including without limitation, Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Website and/or App, shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without consideration of any choice of law or conflict of law principles. YOU AND ALLMINDS AND/OR PMH MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION. This will prohibit you from bringing any class, collective, or consolidated action against Allminds and/or PMH, and will also prohibit you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future such actions brought against Allminds and/or PMH by someone else. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court: there is no judge or jury in arbitration; discovery in arbitration may be more limited than discovery in litigation; and court review of an arbitration award is limited. This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) also applies to claims between you and any Providers, and such Providers will be considered intended third party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
            <p>You and Allminds and/or PMH agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy, whether based on past, present or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof); the Website and/or App; any content currently or previously available on or through the Website and/or App; any Products or Services; your relationship with Allminds and/or PMH; your user data; the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation, or termination of your Account or this Agreement; payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you; any promotions, benefits, or other offers; and any other federal and state statutory and common law claims (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction (which shall be exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, CA) to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s data or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Dispute (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, legality, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) will be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided herein.</p>
            <p>YOU UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT YOU AND ALLMINDS AND/OR PMH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that you and Allminds and/or PMH are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class, collective, or consolidated proceeding. Further, unless you and Allminds and PMH otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, collective, consolidated or representative proceeding.</p>
            <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or any subsequent applicable telephone number. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. It is your and Allminds’s and/or PMH’s intent that the FAA and AAA Rules will preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue will be resolved under the laws of the State of California. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the AAA Rules or FAA.</p>
            <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents at adr.org. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
            <p>Unless you and Allminds and PMH otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Allminds and PMH submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
            <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The prevailing party in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ACCOUNT OWNERS CREATE CLEAR DIRECTIONS REGARDING ACCESS TO AND TRANSFER OF USER DATA IN THE EVENT OF THEIR DEATH OR INCAPACITATION AND SHARE THESE DIRECTIONS WITH A QUALIFIED AND TRUSTED INDIVIDUAL IN ADVANCE. Requests for transfer of the Account Owner role, either by the Account Owner or by an individual legally designated to assume Ownership, must be initiated by you by emailing support@allminds.io.

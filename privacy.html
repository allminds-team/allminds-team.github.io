We and our service providers may use cookies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Websites and Apps through your computer or mobile device. A “cookie” is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user’s computer by the user’s browser. Our Websites and Apps use two types of cookies: Single-session (temporary or browser cookies) and multi-session (persistent or flash cookies). Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open, and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through our Websites or Apps. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. On your computer, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser, and you may have similar capabilities on your mobile device in the preferences for your operating system or browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites or use certain parts of our Apps. Unless you have adjusted your browser or operating system setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites or use our Apps. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods and are used for purposes including tracking the number of unique visitors to our Websites and information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Websites and Apps, such as the number of views a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page, and other pertinent web statistics. Persistent cookies are not managed by the same browser setting as are used for temporary cookies. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by Allminds to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit the Websites or Apps. </p>

We and are service providers may also collect data by using “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (collectively, “pixel tags”) that allow us to know when you visit our Websites or Apps. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information that can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.</p>

                <p>Information We Receive From Other sources. We will combine information we receive from other sources with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).</p>
                <p>Health Information. Some information Allminds collects constitutes PHI under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). As set forth above, PMH (or your own medical provider if you do not use a PMH Provider) will provide you with a Notice of Privacy Practices describing its collection, use and disclosure of your PHI, not Allminds, Inc. Allminds will use or disclose PHI only as permitted in Allminds’s agreements with PMH (or your own medical provider if you do not use a PMH Provider) and we only collect the PHI we need to fully perform our services and to respond to you or your Provider. We may use your PHI to contact you to the extent permitted by law, to provide requested services, to provide information to your Providers and insurers, to obtain payments for our services, to respond to your inquiries and requests, and to respond to inquiries and requests from your Pescribers and benefits program. We may combine your information with other information about you that is available to use, including information from other sources, such as from your Providers, insurers or benefits program, in order to maintain an accurate record of our participants. PHI will not be used for any other purpose, including marketing, without your consent.</p>

                <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your personal information.</p>
                <p>Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Websites or Apps may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
                <p>Do Not Track. Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they “do not track” your online activities. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals. </p>
                <p>Promotional Offers from Allminds. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by Allminds to promote our own products or services, you can check certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also always exercise your right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes by contacting us at the address below. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions. This opt out does not apply to information provided to Allminds as a result of your use of the services.</p>
                <p>Location Information. You can choose whether or not to allow our Apps to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings. If you block the use of location information, some parts of our Apps may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
                <p>Targeted Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) websites (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to see ads, but they will not be based on your online activity. We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the NAI on its website.</p>
                <p>With respect to any PHI Allminds may obtain, you have certain rights under HIPAA to access your data, to restrict use and disclosure of it, to request communication methods, to request corrections to your data, to receive an accounting of disclosures and to receive notice of any breach. See the Notice of Privacy practices provided to you by your Provider for more information.</p>

We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. If Allminds deletes your user account, medical providers, including Providers, and other affiliates may still have the right to retain information as required by applicable law, regulations, or their own retention policy. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Unless otherwise required by law, Allminds will also erase personal information when the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which was collected or otherwise processed; when you withdraw your consent (where lawfulness of processing was based on your consent) and there is no other legal ground for the processing; when you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; when your personal information has been unlawfully processed; and when it is necessary to comply with legal obligations.</p>

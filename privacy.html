Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on the Services and what you view. In doing so, a cookie may enable us to relate your use of the Services to your Personal Information.</p>
              <p>We use information gathered from these tracking technologies so that we can analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may combine information we obtain through tracking technologies with other Personal Information that we have collected about you in order to make our Services, communications and advertisements more targeted to your interests.</p>
              <p>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use some areas of our Services will be limited. You may also opt out of targeted advertisements by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</p>
              <p>Do Not Track</p>
              <p>Please note that the Services are not presently configured to respond to DNT or “do not track” signals from web browsers or mobile devices. As such, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track requests.</p>

For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as your login credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

              <!-- End Title -->

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>California residents have certain rights under the California Shine the Light law and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).</p>  
              <p>CCPA Disclosures</p>              
              <p>In general, within the preceding 12 months:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We have collected the categories of Personal Information listed in Section 2 above.</li>
                <li>We have collected these categories of Personal Information directly from you, when you use our Services, and from third parties for the purposes described in Section 2 above.</li>
                <li>We have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for business purposes: Identifiers and contact information; professional and employment-related information; commercial information; transactional information; and internet and network activity information.</li>
                <li>We have not sold your Personal Information.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>CCPA Privacy Rights</p>
              <p>As of January 1, 2020, certain California residents are entitled to privacy rights under the CCPA. Customers who wish to exercise these rights should direct their requests to the registered member who controls their Personal Information.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The right to know. You have the right to request to know (i) the specific pieces of Personal Information we have about you; (ii) the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you in the last 12 months; (iii) the categories of sources from which that Personal Information was collected; (iv) the categories of your Personal Information that we sold or disclosed in the last 12 months; (v) the categories of third parties to whom your Personal Information was sold or disclosed in the last 12 months; and (vi) the purpose for collecting and selling your Personal Information.</li>
                <li>The right to deletion. You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Information that we have collected or maintain about you. We may deny your request under certain circumstances, such as if we need to comply with our legal obligations or complete a transaction for which your Personal Information was collected. If we deny your request for deletion, we will let you know the reason why.</li>
                <li>The right to equal service. If you choose to exercise any of these rights, we will not discriminate against you in anyway. If you exercise certain rights, understand that you may be unable to use or access certain features of our Services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You may exercise your right to know and your right to deletion twice a year free of charge. To exercise your right to know or your right to deletion, please contact us at support@allminds.com.</p>
              <p>We will take steps to verify your identity before processing your request to know or request to delete. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to verify you are the individual about whom we collected Personal Information. If you have an Account with us, we will use our existing Account authentication practices to verify your identity. If you do not have an Account with us, we may request additional information about you to verify your identity. We will only use the Personal Information provided in the verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a request and to track and document request responses, unless you initially provided the information for another purpose.</p>
              <p>You may use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete. When we verify your agent’s request, we may verify both your and your agent’s identity and request a signed document from you that authorizes your agent to make the request on your behalf. To protect your Personal Information, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>
              <p>Shine the Light</p>
              <p>Our California customers are also entitled to request and obtain from Allminds once per calendar year information about any of your Personal Information shared with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, including the categories of information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we have shared such information. To request this information please contact us at support@allminds.com.</p>
